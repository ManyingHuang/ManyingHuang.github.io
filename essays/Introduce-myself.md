## Introduce Myself

Hi everyone! My name is Manying Huang, and you also can call me Mandy. I was born and raised in China. I immigrated from China to Hawaii in 2016. I am surprised it is already 6 years of living in Hawaii. How times fly! I can speak both Cantonese and Mandarin. I like listening to music, especially K-pop, hiking, reading, and watching movies and dramas, especially Hong Kong and Korean dramas. 

I am studying for a B.B.A. in Accounting at the Shidler College of Business at the University of Hawaii at MƒÅnoa. I chose accounting as my major because I think there have many jobs open relating to accounting in the market, so might easily find a job. Moreover, I prefer to work with numbers and data analysis. 

Above is my brief Introduction. As approach 2023 the year of rabbit, I wish everyone a Happy Lunar New Year!! Another chance to play firecrackers!!
