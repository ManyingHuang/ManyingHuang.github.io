I chose to learn management information systems (MIS) because I think if majoring in business, I better have the skill to manage data. No matter which business major you major in, accounting, finance, marketing, management, human resource, etc., you have a lot of data to deal with and form information to use the information to make the best decision for a company once entering into real work life. Companies need more people who have the skill in information systems to manage different kinds of information systems, like accounting information systems, customer management systems, supply chain management systems, etc. Moreover, I major in accounting, I can use the knowledge from MIS to help a business analyze data to make the best financial decision for the company or the clients to decrease the chances of wasting the company's resources. Furthermore, I think learning MIS set a good platform for studying financial modeling in the future. Also, I think learning MIS can have advantages in the competitive job market. I heard many people say MIS is a challenging class, but I am willing to take that challenge to learn more about MIS, and I am interested in learning some programming languages.
